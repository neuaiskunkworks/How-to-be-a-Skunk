This is an activity we provide, where we will be organizing sessions and helping students build their portfolio, guiding and reviewing GitHub, and other technical platforms where your profile will be shaped professionally and will give feedbacks for improvement accompanied with suggestions.

Development of lessons/tutorials:
This is the platform for students to show their coding and academics skills with professionalism - which can lead them to a RA/TA/Research opportunity.
There will be notebooks/topics provided to the student to work with. The student needs to prepare tutorials using the materials or can create their own materials and get it reviewed within specified time limit. The winning submission will be given RA/TA position after a thorough review.
NOTE: Reason for this opportunity - The research/jobs/RA aspect is NOT open to newbies. ONLY when a student has proven themselves by creating quality learning materials/workshops will they be considered for these externally facing projects.
Kindly DO NOT send a resume and ask for research/job opportunities.  Rather SHOW you can do something through your work/portfolio.
Please be noted - that proving yourself through the challenges is the way to get involved.
